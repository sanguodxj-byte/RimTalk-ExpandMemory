    <RimTalk_Knowledge_HelpContent>【Knowledge Retrieval Logic】
The knowledge library automatically injects relevant knowledge during AI conversations:

1. Keyword Matching: Extracts keywords from conversation context and matches knowledge tags
   • Any Mode: Matches if any keyword is found
   • All Mode: Matches only if all keywords are found
   • ⚠️ Uses substring matching (case-insensitive)

2. Vector Similarity Matching (requires vector service):
   • Uses semantic similarity algorithms to find most relevant knowledge
   • Can find semantically related content even without exact keyword matches

3. Importance Ranking:
   • Matched knowledge is sorted by importance (0.0-1.0) in descending order
   • Only top N most important entries are injected (configurable in settings)

【How to Write Effective Knowledge】

✓ Keep tags clear but avoid too short
  • Good: [Lore-Planet] or [Rules-CombatSystem] (3+ chars)
  • Bad: [War] or [AI] (1-2 chars, prone to false matches)
  • Why: Short tags match too many unrelated contexts

✓ Use compound tags for precision
  • Good: [Lore-Ringworld] or [Character-John-Background]
  • Bad: [John] (may trigger in unrelated conversations)

✓ Tags must be triggerable by conversations
  • Problem: Tag [Rules-CombatSystem] won't trigger in "shooting" "melee" conversations
  • Solution: Use [Combat,Shooting,Melee,Dodge] to add trigger keywords
  • Or: [Rules-Combat,Shooting] keeps categorization while adding triggers

✓ Avoid using skill names as single tags
  • Problem: [Shooting] triggers in ALL conversations of pawns with Shooting skill (≥10)
  • Reason: Match text includes pawn's high-level skill names
  • Bad: [Shooting], [Melee], [Construction] (frequent false matches)
  • Good: [Rules-ShootingCombat,Aim], [Tips-Melee,Brawl] (requires explicit mention)

✓ Make content specific and actionable
  • Good: This planet is a ringworld with 0.8x Earth gravity
  • Bad: This planet is special

✓ Set appropriate importance levels
  • Core settings/rules: 0.8-1.0
  • General background: 0.5-0.7
  • Minor details: 0.3-0.5

✓ Use extended properties wisely
  • Can Be Matched: Enable to participate in keyword/vector retrieval
  • Can Be Extracted: Enable for knowledge chain referencing

【Common Questions】
Q: Why is my knowledge injected too frequently?
A: Tag might be too short or too broad. Use 3+ character compound tags like [Lore-ColonyHistory] instead of [History]

Q: Why isn't my knowledge being injected?
A: Check if knowledge is enabled, matching mode is correct, importance isn't too low, and tags are relevant to conversation

Q: How to make AI use certain knowledge only in specific scenarios?
A: Use precise compound tags (e.g., [Rules-Combat-RangedWeapons]) and moderate importance

✓ Tags must be triggerable by conversations
  • Problem: Tag [Rules-CombatSystem] won't trigger in "shooting" "melee" conversations
  • Solution: Use [Combat,Shooting,Melee,Dodge] to add trigger keywords
  • Or: [Rules-Combat,Shooting] keeps categorization while adding triggers

✓ Avoid using skill names as single tags
  • Problem: [Shooting] triggers in ALL conversations of pawns with Shooting skill (≥10)
  • Reason: Match text includes pawn's high-level skill names
  • Bad: [Shooting], [Melee], [Construction] (frequent false matches)
  • Good: [Rules-ShootingCombat,Aim], [Tips-Melee,Brawl] (requires explicit mention)
